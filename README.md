# MakerSlots
##Overview
The purpose of this project is to create a webapp to schedule MakerBot print times in the Olin College library. To do this, we are using express to run our javascript, mongoose to interact with the database, jquery and angular to handle form data and page navigation, and a variety of other software to handle relevant parts. We want to make users able to create, edit, and delete prints that they've created, view announcements, post on the forum, and ask for help all on the website. We want the NINJAs to be admin users capable of adding announcements, editing printers and prints, and also contributing to the forum as needed. We will have an integrated calendar application that is accessible to basic users.
